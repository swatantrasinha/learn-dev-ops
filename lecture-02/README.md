 # User Management In Linux   

In Linux, user can be in 3 types:   
- root user -> super admin and can do anything    
- system user ->  docker intsalled so OS creates a user to run docker   
- local users -> human users       

All users have id, 
- root user id is **0**   
- system user id is **1-999**   
- local user is **999-60000** (however this 60000 can be changed)   
- for system users if more users are needed(> 999) then it takes id from local users
